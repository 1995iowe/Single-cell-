      <h2> Project Description </h2>
    </header>

    <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
      In recent years, single cell transcriptomics (SCT) becomes much popular research method instead of bulk sequencing technology. It can detect heterogeneous genetic information which is not obtained by mixed sample multicellular sequencing. This leads the whole field of genetics into a new dimension. The main steps of SCT are a) single cell capturing/ sorting, b) reverse transcription/ PCR amplification, c) library building and sequencing, d) biological information analysis. Downstream analysis to single cell experimental data with supervised machine learning can build classification of cells, detect rare subtype of blood cells, refine the ontology of immune cells and conduct diseases diagnosis and health prediction. This project focus on classification of cells using SCT data and machine learning. The objective of this project is to develop and implement an applied system that can use the updating single cell database, perform supervised machine learning, and validate the performance of the system on the follow-up new data sets. The project includes the following steps: data collection, feature extraction, model structure building and training, classification system training, testing and validation, and comparative analysis. This system will be used to determine the cell type and the sorting of one single cell.
